ParseKit
========

An iOS library that handles routine tasks that frequently come up in using Parse' iOS SDK.

The 3 main tasks handled are:
- checking for database object equality
- setting UIImageView's image or UIButton's background image using a PFFile
- reducing a UIImage's file size so that it fits in a PFFile

To use include the static library in your project and import "ParseKit.h".
